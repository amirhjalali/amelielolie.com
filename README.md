# Amelie Lolie - Digital Identity & Fashion Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for [amelielolie.com](https://amelielolie.com), a portfolio exploring **"Human Identity in the Age of Digital Intelligence."**

## Vision
The project moves away from traditional portfolio galleries, functioning instead as a **"Digital Atelier"** where physical self and digital representation dissolve. It positions Amelie Lolie as a pioneer in **Post-Physical Style**, featuring:
- **Digital Fashion:** Showcasing high-fidelity digital garments and cloth simulations.
- **Meta-Human Identity:** Exploration of avatars and digital twins.
- **Avant-Garde Aesthetic:** "Uncanny Glamour" visual language using deep void backgrounds, liquid chrome accents, and subsurface skin tones.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (v4) with custom "Bio-Digital" theme
- **Typography:** Dual-voice system using *Playfair Display* (Human/Header) and *Geist Mono* (Digital/Metadata)
